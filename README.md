## INGREDIENTS ##
1. 3 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
2. 2 teaspoons baking soda
3. 1 teaspoon salt
4. 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
5. 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cardamom
6. 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
7. 2 cups packed light-brown sugar
8. 1/4 cup honey
9. 2 large eggs
10. 2 cups Basic Applesauce, or store-bought chunky applesauce
11. Nonstick cooking spray
12. Confectioners' sugar, optional

### DIRECTIONS ###
* Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and cardamom. Set aside.
* In another bowl, with an electric mixer, beat butter, brown sugar, and honey until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture; beat just until combined. Beat in applesauce.
* Generously coat a nonstick 9-inch tube pan with cooking spray. Spoon batter into pan; smooth top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean (but slightly wet), 50 to 60 minutes.
* Cool on a wire rack 10 minutes. Turn out of pan onto a cutting board or baking sheet; invert cake onto rack, top side up. Cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving, if desired.
